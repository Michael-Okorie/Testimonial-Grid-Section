## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- **Flexbox** for mobile layout
- **CSS Grid** for complex desktop grid layout
- Mobile-first responsive workflow
- Vanilla CSS (no frameworks)
- Accessibility-first approach

---

### What I Learned

This project helped me level up in writing **mobile-first CSS** and using **CSS Grid layout** for complex responsive designs. I also learned how to:

```css
/* Use grid area and auto-rows for flexible card layout */
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(13, 1fr);
    grid-auto-rows: minmax(150px, auto);
    gap: 30px;
}
```

## Continued Development

In future projects, I’d like to:

- Refactor layouts with **SCSS** to improve maintainability
- Add **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for subtle entrance animations
- Practice using `clamp()` and **fluid typography** for scalable text
